Q1. Which things in java attracts u to use java ?



Chapter-1 :- Components of Java Framework -
...........................................
Java is Made up of Three Components - JVM --> JRE --> JDK..

Q1. What is JVM ?
Ans- 1. JVM is a Java Virtual Machine
     2. It is not a Physical Machine ..it is Software that is System to System Dependent.
     3. It converts ByteCode to MachineCode and Machine to Machine jvm matters/Differs like MacOS , Windows.. etc.Every Machine have their own jvm's on which we can run our compiled file.
     4. Also Known as JIT Complier(Just in Time).
     5. It Provides the SuperCool Feature of Portability to java.
     6. To get compiled File of a file we write javac anish.java .

     General Structure of Execution-

     Java Program(Machine/Platform Independent)  -->  Comipler --> ByteCode File   -->   JVM(Machine Dependent)   -->  MachineCode  -->  CPU  ---> Output 
    


Q2. What is JRE ?
Ans- 1. Java Runtime Environment in which we can , run our bytecode file to make machine code.
     2. JRE is made up of Two Things - JVM + Loading of Classes and Libraries.
     3. Compiled file we generted does not contain loaded classes or libraries(eg- utils, math etc.)bcz we are only compiling not running.
     4. So to Load the we uses Runtine Env JRE so when jvm generates requests to load something jre solves ut and we can execute the things.(jre = jvm + loading c/l)

     The flow of run of ByteCode is --
     
      Bytecode -->   Class Loader   --> ByteCode Verifier  --> Interpretor -->  Runtime   --> Hardware  -->  Cpu
                   .....................................................................................
                                       JRE = JVM + Loading



Q3. What is JDK ?
Ans- 1. Java Devlopment Kit which provides Many Functionalities to a System-
         a. JVM
         B. JRE
         C. Java Compilers
         D. Debuggers
         E. Programming Language(Java)
         F. Security

    2. So only if we Downloads JDK it will Provide all the Above Functionalities ,, oracle provides jdk now after 2010.

Note --> JVM , JRE , JDK all are platform Denpendent.


Q4. Can u Please tell , Why Specifically Java Main method is Public ?
Ans- The Core Reason Behind it is that we makes any function public because we can call it from anywhere .. 
     So Main function is considerd as the entry point in java system even u have made 1000's of files so ..
     Jvm first of all calls main method from outside the class to run the program so that's why it is public.

Q. Why java has only one Public Class ?

Chapter-2 :- Methods in Java -
...............................

Q1. Why we Need Methods in Java ?

Q2. What is Methods in Java ?

Q3. Anish Can u please explain the Difference between Function and Methods in Java ?

Q4. What are the Disadvantages of using functions/Methods in Java ?

Q5. Show How the function Syntax is Written and meaning of every word in java ?
    - Access Specifier
    - Return Type
    - Function Name  --> class - Noun , Interface - Adjective(Runnable , serializable) , Methods - verb , Constants - Capital Letters..
    - Parameters/ Arguments
    - Exception Handeling 
    - Function Body.

Q6. What is differnce between paramters and Arguments ?
     p  , a

Q7. What are the Types of Function/Methods in Java ?
    - System Defined Methods.
    - User Defined Methods.
    - Overloaded Functions.
    - Overriding Functions.
    - Static Methods.
         1. Static Methods are Associated to the Class Rather then Object itself. like the Globals
         2. Static Methods can't go for Non static Variable Instances bcz they are Associated with every objects.
         3. Static Methods can't be overridden ,, basically they are hiding not overriding ,, bcz associated with the class.
       

     When we should use Static Methods -
           Ans- Whenever we are working only for simple logics or simple printings then do it .. we should never use it when we are using any type of variable in class.
          
    - Final Methods.
         .. Hinders the overriding of Methods .

    - Abstract Methods.
           1. For defining Abstract methods first make class as abstract.
           2. it should be implimented in child class.

    - Variable Arguments Method.
          1. when we uses variable number of Parameters.
          2. It stores them as List and we can use them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q1. Why we are making and using the constructor?
Ans- Because constructors are initilizars of instance values so without making them we will not be able to make objects and then no use of class will be there.

Q2. How will you differntiate methods and constructor ?
Ans-  These are the Certain Factors -

      1. Constructors do not have Return Type.
      2. Constructor can't be static , final , abstract and synchronized.
   Note --> Constructor and Methods may have same name as class name ...


Q3. Why Constructor can't be static ?

Q4. Why constructor can't be Abstract?

Q5. Why constructor can't be Final ?

Q6. Write the Types of Constructor ?
    - Default
    - No Arg
    - Parameterized Constructor.
    - Private Constructor
    - Public Constructor 
    - Protected Constructor
    

Q7. Explain the Chaining of Constructor using this and Super Keyword?
